# SQL - A Data Analysis Project Using SQL and Python
This is data analysis project for my personal portfolio. It seeks to understand the factors that can affect a student's performance. Factors range from physiological features like ethnicity and gender; family information like mother and father's educational level; and economic factors like tuition and income. 
My report includes a .sql file with the sql queries I used, a Jupyter Notebook file which is the report of the work I did, and a link to the Google Sheets document where I generated all the calculations, graphs and pivot tables. Viewers need to copy and paste the Google Sheets link into their browser. It is on 'view mode' only.
The report includes data description, charts, insights and my conclusions based on the data.
Special thanks to the EntryLevel team for providing the dataset. Data used for this analysis is synthetic.
