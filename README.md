# SQL - A Data Analysis Project Using SQL and Python
A data analysis project for my personal portfolio. It includes a .sql file with sql queries, a Jupyter Notebook file, HTML file and HTML link for viewers who do not have Jupyter Notebook installed but want to see the report. Viewers need to copy and paste the HTML link into their browser to see the report.

Report includes data description, charts, insights and my conclusions based on the data.
